#### <u>CityGirl Application (about the project)</u>

How was your day? <br />
We've all been there before where we keep looking at a clock expecting the time to move faster because we are having such an horrible day. Sometimes grabbing a poison of your choice at a city bar or brewery helps to de-stress and reset yourself. CityGirl application provides an one stop shop for searching for a great drink place as well as nearby parking spots.

##### Acceptance Criteria for the Team

<h3><b>AS A</b> person who is having a really bad day <br/><b>I WANT</b> places where I can have amazing drinks in my city, along with parking options<br/><b>SO THAT</b> I don't have to look into multiple applications to decide where to go and reset myself</h3>
