#### <u>About the project!</u>

Hey City People with vehicles! <br />
"What do you do when you are hungry?" Whenever your stomach throws that question to your brain, now you have three options. #1 you cook and satisfy your stomach; #2 you can just continue to drink water and attempt to satisfy your stomach but you are HANGRY! #3 you spend time searching for a nice restaurant and actually eat something that your stomach deserves. Now... have you ever been in a situation where your phone navigation app placed to in front of the restaurant but you have no idea where to park?! .. oh snap.. once again you are HANGRY and frustrated because you might miss your reservation. We have a solution for you! use our application where you may search for the restaurants and find any near by parking options so you may plan accordingly. WoOoO time to search away!
